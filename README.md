# Neural networks

In this repository FeedForward neural networks are implemented in the C language. The current implementation supports a variable number of layers, as well as neurons in each layer. 
The transfer function of each neuron can be specified from one of the tree definitions of: tangsig, linear, logsig. For training, the well-known optimization method levenberg-marquardt is used. 

If you want to inspect the code of the neural network, check neural_network.c. Otherwise, if you are interested in how it can be used check nntest.c.
